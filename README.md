# ProbCast
ProbCast is an R Package (under continuous development) by researchers at the University of Strathclyde. It is a collection of functions for probabilistic forecasting (mainly wrappers for existing models), cross-validation, evaluation and visualisation. Central to ProbCast is the data class "MultiQR", for storing the results of multiple quantile regression, and methods for working with MultiQR objects.

See package documentation for details and the script "Example.R" to see ProbCast in action.
